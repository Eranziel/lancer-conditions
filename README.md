# lancer-conditions
Foundry VTT module which adds a variety of token status icons. While they are targeted towards LANCER, the module is not system restricted so can be used with any.

Icon graphics are the work of Cancermantis, Hayley, and Tommy on PilotNET, the LANCER Discord server. Some icons are adapted from icons available on game-icons.net under a CC BY license.

## Installation
Manifest URL: https://github.com/Eranziel/lancer-conditions/raw/master/module.json

Copy the manifest into the matching box in the Foundry module installation dialog, and Foundry will take care of the rest!

## Settings
The module settings allow users to customize the added icons on a per-world basis. The icons are organized into several groups based on intended function, each of which can be enabled or disabled individually.

Additionally, the "Keep Stock Icons" setting allows users to either keep or remove the stock Foundry status icons.
